# Welcome to the AI Journey blog!

Starting a new path of discovery is always exciting. For me, it typically involves a healthy dose of trial and error, experimentation, and learning from mistakes. This blog documents my journey into AI development—the discoveries, challenges, and architectural decisions I'm making as I build progressively better AI systems.

My goal is to publish semi-regular posts that capture significant changes impacting architecture, where I'll share insights into the reasoning behind each decision. Think of this as a technical journal of an AI journey, from initial exploration to production-ready systems.

## Where I'm Starting From

I wish I had started documenting this journey about a month ago, when my understanding of AI was roughly on par with the average consumer of **Assistive AI**—I thought of it as essentially a better search engine. After diving into several books and writing working code, I realize how naive that perspective was.

After five years of non-stop, high-intensity work on a project that's finally winding down, I have the bandwidth again to focus on learning and exploration. AI has become that focus.

Here's what I've learned so far:

* **AI is a field, not a single thing**—it encompasses machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, agents, and much more
* **Assistive AI** is where most people start and what they typically think of when they hear "AI"
* **Agentic AI** represents the future—systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously
* **LLMs** are currently the dominant interface layer, but they're just one piece of the puzzle
* The real power comes from combining LLMs with agentic architectures

## Previous Projects

I have several earlier projects that I'll document in future posts:

* My first RAG-powered chatbot
* Integrating 1.5M questions/answers into a chatbot system
* Building a base site with mapped RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)


These projects taught me valuable lessons about data pipelines, retrieval systems, and infrastructure that I'll be building upon.

## What's Next

For now, I'm getting this blog rolling so I can start tracking daily progress, architectural decisions, and the evolution of my understanding. Stay tuned for technical deep-dives, code examples, and honest reflections on what works and what doesn't. 

### Technical Choices

I'll document key tooling and stack decisions here for high-level tracking. These choices shape the foundation of everything I'm building.

**1. MkDocs for Documentation and Blog**

- High quality and flexible—perfect for technical documentation
- Large, active community with extensive plugins and themes
- Markdown-based workflow that integrates well with development processes

**2. GitHub Hosting**

- Cost-effective—using the free tier for now
- Tightly integrated with public code repositories
- Minimal learning curve given my existing Git workflow

**3. Python as Primary Language**

- My go-to language with deep prior knowledge
- The industry standard for data science and AI development
- Rich ecosystem of libraries (NumPy, PyTorch, LangChain, etc.)
