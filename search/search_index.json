For me, it typically involves a healthy dose of trial and error, experimentation, and learning from mistakes. This blog documents my journey into AI development\u2014the discoveries, challenges, and architectural decisions I'm making as I build progressively better AI systems.</p> <p>My goal is to publish semi-regular posts that capture significant changes impacting architecture, where I'll share insights into the reasoning behind each decision. Think of this as a technical journal of an AI journey, from initial exploration to production-ready systems.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/12/01/welcome/#where-im-starting-from","title":"Where I'm Starting From","text":"<p>I wish I had started documenting this journey about a month ago, when my understanding of AI was roughly on par with the average consumer of Assistive AI\u2014I thought of it as essentially a better search engine. After diving into several books and writing working code, I realize how naive that perspective was.</p> <p>After five years of non-stop, high-intensity work on a project that's finally winding down, I have the bandwidth again to focus on learning and exploration. AI has become that focus.</p> <p>Here's what I've learned so far:</p> <ul> <li>AI is a field, not a single thing\u2014it encompasses machine learning, deep learning, LLMs, agents, and much more</li> <li>Assistive AI is where most people start and what they typically think of when they hear \"AI\"</li> <li>Agentic AI represents the future\u2014systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously</li> <li>LLMs are currently the dominant interface layer, but they're just one piece of the puzzle</li> <li>The real power comes from combining LLMs with agentic architectures</li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2025/12/01/welcome/#previous-projects","title":"Previous Projects","text":"<p>I have several earlier projects that I'll document in future posts:</p> <ul> <li>My first RAG-powered chatbot</li> <li>Integrating 1.5M questions/answers into a chatbot system</li> <li>Building a base site with mapped RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</li> </ul> <p>These projects taught me valuable lessons about data pipelines, retrieval systems, and infrastructure that I'll be building upon.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/12/01/welcome/#whats-next","title":"What's Next","text":"<p>For now, I'm getting this blog rolling so I can start tracking daily progress, architectural decisions, and the evolution of my understanding.

MkDocs for Documentation and Blog</p> <ul> <li>High quality and flexible\u2014perfect for technical documentation</li> <li>Large, active community with extensive plugins and themes</li> <li>Markdown-based workflow that integrates well with development processes</li> </ul> <p>2. GitHub Hosting</p> <ul> <li>Cost-effective\u2014using the free tier for now</li> <li>Tightly integrated with public code repositories</li> <li>Minimal learning curve given my existing Git workflow</li> </ul> <p>3. Python as Primary Language</p> <ul> <li>My go-to language with deep prior knowledge</li> <li>The industry standard for data science and AI development</li> <li>Rich ecosystem of libraries (NumPy, PyTorch, LangChain, etc.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"posts/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/ai/","title":"AI","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/mkdocs/","title":"MkDocs","text":""}]}
